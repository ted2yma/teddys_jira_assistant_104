# Thanks for supporting Teddy's Jira Assistant!

## 為什麼會有這個repo? Why have this repository?

* 因為林北在104上班，是用Jira來追單，每次推Git都需要貼單號跟單名，本著「人性本懶」的心態弄了一個extension出來方便我複製貼上而已。 Due to me work in 104 Corp and using Jira to managing my work flow, I need to CopynPaste the issue track number and name to commit message when I commit any changes in git. So me make this shit.
* Jira的Header很肥大，比黑O還大，在寸土寸金的MBP13螢幕裡，少了一個30公分的Header就解放了多一點的空間，多一點空間就能看到多一點issue...Fuck it單可以少一點？ The Header in Jira is bigger then a black dick. Kill that dick can see more issues on the board...it means toooo much of issues. Fuck it.
* 我們每週都要check工時多少、issue完成多少，然後貼到Excel上做統計，又貼東西... We have to check how much of hours of issues we need to complete at this sprint and check how many issues I done at this week, than we need to paste the data to a spreadsheet. Fuck copy and paste again.

## Clone後要幹嘛？ What I have to do after I clone this repo?

1. 先 `npm run watch` 把檔案rebuild更新一下 Firstly, use `npm run watch` to update the file in `/dist`.
2. 然後到Chrome extension manager, 打開 `Developer mode` Than go to Chrome extension manager and turn on `Developer mode`
3. 點擊 `Load unpacked` 並打開 `/dist` 的資料夾，然後就會在 `All extension` 看到 'Teddys Jira Assistant' Click `Load unpacked` and pickup `/dist` folder, than you'll see 'Teddys Jira Assistant' in `All extension`.
4. 去Jira使用他 Go to Jira and enjoy it.
